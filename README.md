This github project is part of the overall Egeria project. See the [egeria project](https://github.com/odpi/egeria) for further information. The same governance rules & maintainer status apply as for that project

## egeria-k8s-operator

This project provides a Kubernetes operator to support the deployment of Egeria. This is in addition to the current
support in the main project for building the base egeria container images, as well as a few helm charts that make use of them.

Documentation can be found on our new [Egeria Documentation Site](https://odpi.github.io/egeria-docs/guides/admin/kubernetes/intro/)

Please engage via our main project [slack channels](slack.odpi.org), team calls, or via github issues in this repo.

See [DEVELOP.md](DEVELOP.md) for more specific details of the implementation and how to build.
